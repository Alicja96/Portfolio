## [Sentiment Analysis of Killing Eve TV Series :thumbsup:](https://github.com/Alicja96/Sentiment-Analysis-of-Killing-Eve-TV-Series.git)
Tools: beautifulsoup, selenium, requests, pandas, nltk, langdetect, plotly, scikit-learn, imblearn, textblob, wordcloud

Performed web scraping to extract reviews of popular tv series to predict their polarity using lexicon-based approaches (TextBlob, VADER) and machine learning classifiers such as Naive Bayes, SVM, and Logistic Regression while dealing with imbalanced data.
